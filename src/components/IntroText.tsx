      Let's say you're disabled from working and you receive a monthly amount
      from an insurance company under a private long-term disability insurance
      policy. Now let's say that insurance company (the "insurer") has decided
      to terminate your benefits, but your doctors say you are still disabled
      and unable to work. If you want to sue for those benefits, you will need
      to account for past benefits owing and future benefit.
