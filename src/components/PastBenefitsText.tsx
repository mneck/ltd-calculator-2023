      <b>Past benefits</b> are relatively easy to calculate. This would be the
      monthly amount you are owed multiplied by the number of months between the
      last day you received benefits and the day you receive compensation. So if
      the last date you received benefits was December 31, 2022, and the date
      you hypothetically receive compensation is July 15, we could say you were
      denied benefits for 5 months and 15 days, or 5.5 months. If you received a
      monthly benefit of $1000, then your past benefits owing would be $5,500
      (5.5 x $1000).
